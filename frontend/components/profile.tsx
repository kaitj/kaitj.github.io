      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I&apos;m a researcher and software developer who enjoys working in
        cross-functional teams and has a passion for leveraging diverse
        technologies to drive meaningful advancements in the field of medical
        research. In my current role, I develop reproducible data processing
        pipelines, build web applications, and automate workflows to streamline
        the software development and delivery processes. Check out my{" "}

          Khan Computational Imaging Lab
        </a>{" "}
        at the University of Western Ontario, where my research involved
        engineering processing pipelines for reproducible analysis and applied
        machine learning to large datasets in order to study the human brain.
        Prior to joining the lab, I completed a Bachelor&apos;s of Engineering
        from McMaster University.
