This past weekend was a not so subtle reminder that winter is here. Between the sub-zero temperatures (felt like -30C) and the storm that came through, it was a perfect weekend to clean up around the house and start watching Game of Thrones from the beginning again. It was also the first weekend where there was a bit of free time...no presentations to prep for, a few more weeks until the next scholarship deadline, as well as an abstract deadline.

Despite the weather, we braved the storm to go out for brunch. There are lots of unique cafes in town. This one was a small little cafe in the downtown core. I had a breakfast burrito and it was filled! The portions are large, the coffee was bottomless and most importantly, the atmosphere was amazing. It had a 70s/80s diner feel. There were knitted blankets and board games.

We also wandered into the Italian bakery in town for the first time. There was a lot of food that could not be found anywere else. Additionally, the bread (and the cheesecakes here) are amazing. Though I've never stepped foot in the bakery myself, I have been lucky enough to have cheesecakes from them and they taste amazing.
