Hello! Happy New Year!

This is the first post of the new year and for this new site! I started looking into setting up a personal web page a few weeks ago in the middle of December 2018 and thought "hmm, the first day of 2019 would be a perfect time to launch". Really have to thank the resources available out there (the countless tutorials and YouTube videos watched to make this happen, and to the creator of this page's Jekyll theme). Despite having used Github pages previously for events, I am really just starting to explore what can be implemented into these.

I am not too sure what I will be doing with this website yet, but it will gradually evolve over time as most websites do. The publications page will get updated as publications are printed and posters & talks are given. A new "projects" page will likely get added as projects get completed. It might even get populated with a few ongoing open-source projects in-progress. As for this blog page, it will likely get filled with pictures, thoughts, ideas, conference blogs and maybe some short videos if those happen (or a combination of all of the above).

Reflecting on 2018, a lot has happened. I didn't think a year ago, I would have been here with a web page. I was still a Master's candidate at this time last year, pouring over papers to get a better grasp of the vast amount of content for the background and theory of my project, hoping to successfully reclassify as a PhD candidate. Following reclassification, I was preparing to give my first talk at an international conference. That was both nerve wracking and exhilirating. Attending the conference and interacting with everyone really reinforced my decision to continue with graduate research. The summer then past by with thoughts of getting some research done in order to work on my first publication. However, unexpected events occured and this has been slow progress. While that first publication has not yet been submitted, it is definitely in the works and getting closer and closer. And come September, it was time to prepare for the yearly ritual of submitting scholarship applications.

That has also been a lot of personal growth. I'm not sure when it happened, but over time, I started to read less and less books. While the paper reading increased, I hadn't picked up a book since probably the final Harry Potter book. So sometime near the end of summer, I decided I wanted to read more. Started with 60 or so pages a day and grew to reading a book a week. It was also at this time, I started to expand my cooking. Before this, I was cooking the same foods every week. It felt like I was growing in every part of my personal life and getting a better grasp of things. I could go on and on about this, but maybe I will save that for another post.

There are a number of things I am looking forward to in 2019. Academically, I am waiting to hear back regarding two scholarships and will be applying to another in the coming weeks. This summer I will have to complete my mid-level exams, so in the coming weeks I will likely be scheduling a meeting with my committee. I am submitting some work to a conference for this summer and am also waiting to hear the results of a local conference. Outside of acamedia, I am not sure what the year will bring, but I am looking forward to it.

That is probably enough rambling for now! Thanks for visiting the page and reading this post. Stay tuned for more.
