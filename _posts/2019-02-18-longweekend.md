The past week brought along another day of freezing rain, causing the school to be closed again. This caused some scheduling issues with some midterms being cancelled / rescheduled and another rescheduling of the tutorial section that I teach. Finding a rooms to book on short notice did cause some issues. Even though I booked a room, with the weather causing cancellations, the room ended up being double booked. Luckily, I was able to find a room, though after a slight delay.

The week also included a chance to test out the Connectome Workbench. I've come across it in the past, but never really made use of it or really sat down to figure out how to use it. And though I didn't want to spend too much time on it, I've come to learn some useful commands which may come in handy in the future. This may be helpful in the future if I ever have a need to work with cortical parcellations or surface files.

Because it was a long weekend, I wound up driving a couple of hours back home to spend some time with family and friends. Grabbed a quick bite in Hamilton with some friends on the way home Friday evening and played a few rounds of Anomia. Saturday was a split between doing a bit of work during the day and then going downtown to see the Arkells play. The concert was a great time with almost everyone in the place on their feet for the whole 2 hours the band played. Sunday was a day of recovery. This most involved hanging out with family. Sunday night ended up being a board game night, which was great as it started to snow hard again later in the evening. Come Monday, it was back to doing a bit of work, catching up on reading a few papers that I have been meaning to read for a while, and of course making the drive back to London.
