February flew by. It feels as though the month just started, but in a few days, March will be here. This past month has had some ups and downs. As I had mentioned in a previous post, we had a couple of snow days. There was also a few hiccups with some of the ongoing work, which may have been worked through this past week. It was also a month where an abstract was submitted (and recently accepted) and I did deeper dive into machine/deep learning. After about 8 weeks of going through some of the material, I feel like I have a much better grasp of machine/deep learning in theory and hope to have an opportunity to implement some of what I've learned in practice in the future.

Not much has been planned for the month of March so far. There is a regional conference at the end of the month, but aside from that March should be a relatively quiet month. I hope to hear back regarding 1 (maybe 2) scholarships next month which will hopefully bring good news.

Personally, the past two months have been rough for going to the gym and working out. With a trip planned for later in the year, will definitely need to get back into the routine of going to the gym and getting into shape for a hike during the trip.

Looking forward to what March brings (hopefully better gym attendance)!
