Around this time every year, the majority of people are coming up "resolutions" or goals that they want to try to accomplish in the upcoming year. I'm no different. It's a great time to reset, set new goals, and try new things. While we shouldn't limit ourselves to doing this around the new year, the sense of a fresh start is a great feeling to have when setting new goals.

I have set some personal goals that I want to improve upon in the first few months of 2019. These are things I had already started the previous year and I am hoping to better some of my practices to help achieve these goals. And hopefully (if I don't forget), I will look back in a few months to see if I am actually working towards these goals and if I have to change what I am doing to work towards them.

1. Finances - I'm sure this is on most people's goals/resolutions every year. I've already been working on this throuhgout most of the past year and even before that, but I feel like I could get better at this. Sticking to budgets more and saving better for things like trips, vacations, etc.

2. Work on photography / videography - Here is something that has really fascinated me in the last few years (probably with the rise of social media). I've picked up a camera and dabbled. I've editted some photos and cut some videos together. I am hoping this year I will get to do this more and really hone some of these skills.

3. Expand the cookbook - It wasn't until I started university that I really started to learn to cook. Even then, I basically had the same 10-15 recipes throughout my undergrad and the first year of my graduate schooling. The past year I've started to learn more about cooking and try out different recipes. I hope to continue this into 2019.

4. Put myself out there - As an introverted person, I enjoy my alone time and hanging out with the family and friends that I already know. I don't really like putting myself out there. I've been trying (one small step at a time) since final few months of 2018 to start putting myself out there. It can (hopefully) only help with future goals. This blog one of the few ways I am hoping will help with this.

5. Enjoy nature - The last couple of years, I have had the pleasure of just enjoying nature. Sitting or standing in a spot and taking everything in...the smells, sounds and sights. Something about just being in the moment (and maybe this is the key more than anything) brings some serenity. Looking back, these are some of the best moments. I haven't really gone to try to find some of these places in the winter, but now is as good a time as any to start.

While I don't necessarily believe resolutions should be limited to the new year, it is a great time to get started on some of those goals. I've posted a few of my own goals to start 2019, but more goals will be set throughout the year. Looking forward to a great year and everything it'll bring!
