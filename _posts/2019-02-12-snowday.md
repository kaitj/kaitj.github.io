Before this post starts, I should mention these monthly reviews will likely be a normal thing.

So January brought the start of a new school term, a seminar presentation, abstract comments, and a final scholarship application. With the new school term, I was getting ready to get back into the routine and responsibilities of my teaching assistantship. This included updating tutorial slide content and preparing tutorial material each week. With this being the third year with this course and a year since previously teaching the material, I also had to brush up on the content. The other thing that came up quickly was my seminar presentation. It was the second week of January, which meant a lot of the slides were prepared before the Christmas break. Had to have a quick refresher on what I had put in the slides and make some changes to make it more suitable for the audience. This years presentation was also the best I have felt presenting the material and was good in terms of time (11 minutes and 30 seconds for a 12-minute talk). Fast forward to roughly two weeks ago, we also got reviewer comments for a local conference submission. Comments were all positive, with some questions and comments that I will likely try to address during the presentation. We have not been told which abstracts are talks and which are posters, but that information will likely be given to us in the coming weeks. Lastly, I spent the last week editing my final scholarship application of the academic year. It was a similar submission as a previous scholarship, but I had to make a few changes to the references and also make sure it was under the character count.

So with that behind us, there are also a number of things to look forward to in the month of February (both academic and non-academic):
 * Super Bowl (which just happened this past weekend)
 * Arkell's Concert
 * A few planned dinners
 * CAN Abstract deadline
 * (and hopefully) milder weather
