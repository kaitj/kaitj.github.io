Hi there and thanks for visiting!

I develop tools and techniques to study the structural conections of the brain and how it changes due to neurological and psychiatric disorders. My research focus is on developing techniques to investigate the short-range U-shaped structural connections (superficial white matter) using multi-parametric MRI and study such pathways in patient populations. I am also a supporter of open science practices and education.
