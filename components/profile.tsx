      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        I earned my PhD in the{" "}
        <a href="https://khanlab.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          Khan Computational Imaging Lab
        </a>{" "}
        at the University of Western Ontario, where I engineered data processing
        pipelines for reproducible analysis and applied machine learning to
        large neuroimaging datasets in order to study the connections of the
        brain. Prior to joining the lab, I completed a Bachelor&apos;s of
        Engineering from McMaster University.
