            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>I am a PhD Candidate in the <a href="https://khanlab.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Khan Computational Imaging Lab</a> at Western University where I develop tools and pipelines to process and analyze the brain&apos;s short-change connections. Previously, I completed a Bachelor&apos;s of Engineering (Electrical and Biomedical) from McMaster University.</p>

            <p>While I primarily use Python, I have experience with a variety of programming languages and software packages. Take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/kaitj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Github</a> for some of the projects I have been involved in! </p>

            <p>I am always happy to chat about any previous or potential projects - just send me a message through <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonkai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Twitter</a> or by <a href="mailto:tkai@uwo.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="Email">email</a>.</p>
