            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>I earned my PhD in the <a href="https://khanlab.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Khan Computational Imaging Lab</a> at Western University where I developed tools, reproducible pipelines and applied machine learning to large neuroimaging datasets to study the connections of the brain. I also previously completed a Bachelor&apos;s of Engineering from McMaster University.</p>

            <p>While I primarily code in Python, I have experience with a variety of programming languages and software packages. Take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/kaitj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Github</a> for some of the projects I have been involved in! </p>

            <p>I am always happy to chat about any previous or potential projects - just send me a message through <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonkai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Twitter</a> or by <a href="mailto:tkai@uwo.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="Email">email</a>.</p>
